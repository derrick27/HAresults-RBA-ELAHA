README: Wi-Fi Handover Algorithm Simulation Results

Overview
This repository contains the simulation results of Wi-Fi handover algorithms, specifically the Received Signal Indicator-Based Algorithm (RBA) and the Enhanced Load Aware Handover Algorithm (ELAHA). The simulations evaluate the performance of these algorithms in a network with multiple access points (APs) and mobile stations. The focus is on key performance metrics such as end-to-end delay, jitter, throughput, packet loss rate, and number of handover.
